Requirement Dependency Graph Generator - EECS 22L - Aatif Ahmed

Utilized GitHub Copilot as an AI assistant to help understand certain parts of the project and help me with the auto-completion of the code. Used Copilot as a tool to help detect any mistakes in the code. To fix the errors in the Makefile, I used Copilot by asking what certain errors meant, using it to help understand my mistakes. To build the directory, I asked Copilot how to compile into a build directory. To auto-complete the code, I used GitHub Copilot to help me.
