# Requirement-Dependency-Graph-Generator
Requirement Dependency Graph Generator - EECS 22L - Aatif Ahmed

Utilized GitHub Copilot as an AI assistant to help understand certain parts of the project and help me with the auto-completion of the code. Used Copilot as a tool to help detect any mistakes in the code. To fix the errors in the Makefile, I used Copilot by asking it what certain errors meant, and it helped me understand my mistakes. To build the directory, I asked Copilot how to compile into a build directory. To auto-complete the code, I used GitHub Copilot to help me.

# Modules
- **graph.c/h**: Handles the requirement graph data structure and printing.
- **parse.c/h**: Parses the SRS file and extracts requirements and dependencies.
- **report.c/h**: Generates the markdown report from the dependency graph.
- **main.c**: Entry point; coordinates the workflow.

# AI Tool Disclosure
AI tools were used to assist with code completion and debugging, but I designed all the logic and structure.
